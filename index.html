    <b>Shannen Says</b> is an eight-episode American
     reality television series broadcast on

     The show focuses on the preparations for
      the wedding of actress Shannen Doherty and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding planner David Tutera. Doherty and Iswarienko developed the show as a way to document the stress on a couple while planning their wedding.
